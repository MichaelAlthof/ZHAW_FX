Name of Quantlet : MomentumStrategyFX

Description : 'Contains the Momentum strategy for the cross-sectional portfolio. For our approach, we apply the algorithm presented 
by Baz et al. (2015) to generate the momentum signal, based on three crossovers of exponential moving averages with different 
time horizons. The three different crossovers identify short-, medium-, and long-term trends respectively. A signal is generated for 
each time horizon and then all these signals are combined to build a trade signal. Based on the generated trading signals, 
we create the portfolio with weights prespecified by user.'
