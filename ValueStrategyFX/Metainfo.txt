Name of Quantlet : ValueStrategyFX

Description : 'Contains the Value strategy for the cross-sectional portfolio, which involves buying (selling) assets that 
are undervaluated (overvaluated) relative to a measure of fundamental value.  For our approach, we apply the algorithm presented 
by Baz et al. (2015) to generate the trading signal, based on the fundamental value represented by the real exchange rate. 
Based on the generated trading signals, we create the cross sectional portfolio.'
